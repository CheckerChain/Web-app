(a) finding out fake or not
(b) Launching platform

Users can simply post products using [CHECKR] token - they are called "Posters". Users can participate as "Checkers" who validate the product. Users can be given a badge of "Creator" for original makers. Posts and reviews can be influenced further by "influencers" (does not change scores but changes visibility).
